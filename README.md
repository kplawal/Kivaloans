# Kivaloans
In this project, I will be visualizing and looking for insights in a dataset from Kaggle,
that contains information about loans awarded by the non-profit Kiva.
Using Seaborn, i will be exploring the average loan amount by country using aggregated bar charts,
and visualize the distribution of loan amount by project type and gender using box plots and violin plots
